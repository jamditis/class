## New assignment descriptions

### Alien planet travel poster (50 pts)
**Due:** Thursday, March 5

Using the design principles covered in Week 6, create a travel poster for a fictional alien planet. This assignment forces you to apply contrast, hierarchy, alignment, and balance to content you can't rely on familiarity to make work. The poster should:
- Be print-ready at 11x17 inches, 300 DPI
- Include a compelling headline, tagline, and at least one visual element
- Demonstrate clear visual hierarchy and intentional use of color
- Feel like something you'd actually see hanging in a travel agency (on another planet)

This is completed as an in-class activity during Week 6 and due by the start of class the following Thursday.

### Featured images + social graphics (75 pts)
**Due:** Thursday, April 23

Create a cohesive set of visual assets for your final project organization. This bundle includes:
- **3 featured images** for blog posts or articles (1200x630 pixels, optimized for web)
- **3 social media graphics** (square format, 1080x1080 pixels)

All six graphics must:
- Follow consistent branding (colors, fonts, visual style)
- Include proper alt text descriptions
- Be export-ready for web use (PNG or JPEG, optimized file size)

This assignment directly feeds into your final multimedia asset package.

### Campaign strategy (75 pts)
**Due:** Thursday, April 30

Write a 2-3 page strategic document that outlines how your organization would deploy the assets you've created throughout the semester. Include:
- **Campaign goal:** What are you trying to achieve?
- **Target audience:** Who are you reaching (reference your persona)?
- **Platform strategy:** Where will these assets live and why?
- **Content calendar:** A two-week sample showing when and where each asset type would be posted
- **Success metrics:** How will you measure whether this worked?

This is the "instruction manual" that explains how all your semester work fits together.

## Summary of changes from original syllabus

### 1. Spring Break moved to Week 8
The original syllabus had Spring Break during Week 9, but March 7-15 actually falls during Week 8 of the semester. This has been corrected.

### 2. Research dossier shifted to Week 10
Previously due during Week 9 (the same week the topic was covered), the research dossier is now due during Week 10. This gives students a full week after learning about research and synthesis to complete the assignment.

### 3. User persona shifted to Week 11
With the research dossier moving to Week 10, the user/customer persona assignment now falls due during Week 11 (was Week 10). This maintains the logical progression: research first, then persona development.

### 4. Three new graded assignments added

| Assignment | Points | Rationale |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| Alien planet travel poster | 50 | Converts the in-class design activity into a graded deliverable |
| Featured images + social graphics | 75 | Fills the gap in Weeks 13-14 and creates portfolio-ready assets |
| Campaign strategy | 75 | Ties the semester's work together with strategic thinking |

### 5. Point total increased
The total points before the final project increased from 345 to 545 pts with the addition of three new assignments worth 200 points combined.

### 6. Assignment spacing improved
No assignments are due the same week their topic is introduced. Students have at least one class session between learning content and submitting related work.
