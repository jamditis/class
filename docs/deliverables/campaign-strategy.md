## What this deliverable is

A campaign strategy document is the bridge between your research and your creative output. It answers the question: given everything you learned in the research dossier, what are you actually going to do?

It forces you to make decisions before you start producing content — which platforms, which audiences, what goals, how you'll know if it worked. The goal is clarity, not length. This should be a tight, specific 1–2 page document, not a sprawling report.

## The structure

Use this framework: **Goal → Strategies → Tactics → KPIs → CTAs**

### Goal

One sentence. What does this campaign accomplish? Make it specific enough that you can later evaluate whether you achieved it.

Weak goal:
> Grow our Instagram following.

Strong goal:
> Increase awareness of Grounds for Change among MSU graduate students (ages 22–30) in Montclair, driving 40 new in-store visits from that segment by April 30.

The strong version names the audience, specifies the outcome (visits, not followers), includes a number, and sets a timeframe.

### Strategies

Strategies are the general approaches you'll use to reach your goal. They're directional, not specific. You'll have 2–4 strategies for a typical campaign.

**Example:**

> **Strategy 1:** Build visibility on platforms where the target audience discovers new local places (Instagram, TikTok).
>
> **Strategy 2:** Create content that communicates our work-friendliness and coffee quality — the two things our audience cares about most and can't tell from our current presence.
>
> **Strategy 3:** Partner with MSU-adjacent accounts to reach students who aren't already following us.

### Tactics

Tactics are the specific, actionable things you'll do to execute each strategy. Each tactic maps to a strategy.

**Example (mapped to Strategy 1 and 2 above):**

> - Post 4x/week on Instagram: Tuesdays and Thursdays (high-intent weekday traffic), Saturday (community/weekend), and one "behind the scenes" post per week showing the sourcing or preparation process
> - Produce 2 TikToks per month: one educational (coffee technique or origin) and one showing the work environment
> - Create a "regulars highlight" story series featuring real customers (with permission) who work from the shop
> - Run one 2-week paid Instagram promotion targeting Montclair + MSU zip codes, 22–30 demographic

### KPIs (key performance indicators)

How will you measure success? These should be specific numbers tied to your goal.

**Example:**

| Metric | Baseline (now) | Target (end of campaign) |
|--------|----------------|--------------------------|
| Instagram followers | 340 | 500 |
| Average post engagement rate | 1.8% | 3.5% |
| New customer mentions in Google reviews | 2 in last 3 months | 8 in next 3 months |
| First-time visitors citing social media | No tracking | Start tracking; target 15/month |

Pick 3–5 KPIs max. More than that and you stop tracking all of them.

### CTAs (calls to action)

Every piece of content needs a CTA — a specific action you're asking the audience to take. Define the CTAs for your campaign so they're consistent across all content.

**Example:**

> - **Primary CTA:** "Stop by this week" — we want people to come in, not just follow
> - **Secondary CTA:** "Tag us when you're working from here" — builds UGC (user-generated content) and social proof
> - **Story CTA:** "Drop a reply — what do you usually order?" — drives the algorithm and gives us data on preferences

---

## Content calendar

Include a two-week sample calendar showing when and where each piece of content would be posted.

**Example:**

| Date | Platform | Content type | Topic | CTA |
|------|----------|--------------|-------|-----|
| Mon Feb 24 | Instagram | Photo | Morning espresso bar setup | "Come see us before 9" |
| Tue Feb 25 | Instagram | Reel | How we dial in a new bean | "Tag a coffee person who gets it" |
| Wed Feb 26 | TikTok | Video | "What to order if you've never been" | "See you soon" |
| Thu Feb 27 | Instagram Stories | Poll | "Work from home or coffee shop?" | Reply with your answer |
| Sat Mar 1 | Instagram | Photo | Weekend crowd + natural light | "We're open till 5" |
| Mon Mar 3 | Instagram | Carousel | Ethiopia Yirgacheffe farm story | "Ask us about it next time you're in" |
| Tue Mar 4 | TikTok | Video | Student study session time-lapse | "WiFi is fast, seats are open" |
| Thu Mar 6 | Instagram | Customer feature | Regular with permission | "Know a regular we should feature?" |

## What a finished strategy looks like

A strong campaign strategy document:

- Is 1–2 pages (3 max)
- Has specific numbers everywhere — not "more engagement" but "3.5% engagement rate"
- Shows you understand your audience from the persona and dossier work
- Makes decisions — it doesn't hedge with "we might also try..."
- Connects every tactic back to a strategy and a goal

A weak one:
- Says "post consistently on social media" without defining consistently
- Lists platforms without explaining why those platforms for that audience
- Has KPIs like "grow brand awareness" that can't be measured

## Common mistakes

- **Strategies that are actually tactics.** "Post on Instagram three times a week" is a tactic, not a strategy. The strategy is why you're on Instagram, what you're communicating, and to whom.
- **Too many goals.** One campaign, one primary goal. You can have secondary goals, but make them secondary.
- **Ignoring platform behavior.** A content calendar that posts the exact same thing to Instagram and TikTok on the same day isn't a strategy — it's copy-paste. Each platform has different native formats, posting rhythms, and audience expectations.
- **No baseline.** If you don't know your starting numbers, you can't measure progress. Check your analytics before you write the KPIs.
