## What this deliverable is

You'll write nine social media captions for the final project. Three of them must be for Twitter/X — a requirement that forces a specific kind of discipline that will improve all your other writing.

Captions are where brand voice lives in practice. Anyone can write a sentence about coffee. Writing nine distinct captions that all sound like the same brand, across different platforms, for different content types — that's the actual skill.

## Platform differences

Before writing anything, understand that each platform has a different native register. Copying the same caption across all platforms is a rookie mistake.

| Platform | Tone | Optimal length | Key behaviors |
|----------|------|----------------|---------------|
| Instagram | Conversational, visual | 125–150 chars visible (more is fine, but front-load) | Hashtags at end or in first comment; use line breaks |
| Twitter/X | Direct, punchy | 280 chars max | No hashtags (they tank reach in 2026); link in reply if needed |
| LinkedIn | Professional, perspective-driven | 150–300 chars visible | First line must hook — "See more" cuts off at ~210 chars |
| Facebook | Casual, community-oriented | 40–80 chars gets highest engagement | Questions and CTAs perform well |

## The nine captions

### Three Twitter/X captions

The 280-character limit forces a kind of economy that makes you a better writer everywhere. You cannot hedge. You cannot meander. Every word has to earn its place.

**What makes a strong Twitter caption:**

- Lead with the most interesting thing — not context, not setup
- Cut every qualifier ("kind of," "somewhat," "in some ways")
- Make a real claim or observation — not a soft one
- End with something that makes the reader want to respond or share

**Examples:**

*For the call-out piece:*
> Your local coffee shop probably has a better story than Starbucks. They're just not telling it. Here's why independent cafés keep losing the discoverability battle — and what the ones winning are doing differently.

*(Note: 254 chars. Uses almost the full limit. Asks a question implicitly. Specific enough to be interesting, vague enough to require a click.)*

*For a product post:*
> We changed our milk program last month. Switched to oat from two local farms. Costs more. Tastes better. Here's the breakdown if you care about that sort of thing:

*(Assumes a link in the reply. Confident, direct voice. No exclamation points.)*

*Standalone thought (no link needed):*
> The barista who knows your order isn't just being friendly. They're doing exactly what every brand spends thousands trying to replicate. We just call it remembering people.

*(No CTA. Works as a brand statement on its own. Gets shared because it's true.)*

### Three Instagram captions

Instagram gives you more room, but the first sentence is still doing the heavy lifting — it's what people see before "More."

**Structure:**
1. **Hook** — the first line, before "More." This is what determines whether people keep reading.
2. **Body** — expand the thought, tell the story, provide context
3. **CTA** — give people somewhere to go (comment, tag, visit, save)
4. **Hashtags** — end of caption or first comment (3–5 targeted, not 30 generic ones)

**Example:**

*For an educational post about sourcing:*

> We've been working with the same farm in Oaxaca for four years now.
>
> This is the part that doesn't show up in the cup — the emails in February when the cherry crop comes in light, the photos from the drying beds, the conversation about what worked last season and what didn't.
>
> The relationship is the supply chain. We thought you should know who's growing your coffee.
>
> Drop a comment if you want to hear more about where this batch came from. ☕

*Why it works:* The first line is specific and surprising — four years is a concrete number. The body adds context without over-explaining. The CTA invites engagement without demanding it.

### Three LinkedIn captions

LinkedIn rewards professional insight and first-person perspective. It's the platform where "here's what I learned" performs better than "here's what we offer."

Write from a perspective that's useful to your audience, not just promotional.

**Example:**

*From the brand's founder voice:*

> Three years ago we opened Grounds for Change without a marketing plan.
>
> We had great coffee, a good location, and a vague sense that "people would find us."
>
> They didn't. Not until we started treating our Instagram like we treated our menu — with care, with intention, and with something worth saying.
>
> Here's what changed when we started telling the story behind the cup:

*(Assumes a link to the blog post below. First line is surprising. The lesson is universal — any small business owner relates to "people will find us." Works on LinkedIn because it's about a business decision, not just a product.)*

## Writing nine captions without repeating yourself

The hardest part isn't writing one good caption. It's writing nine that all sound like the same voice but aren't copies of each other.

Strategy: vary the **angle**, not just the **words**.

For the same subject (e.g., your sourcing story), nine angles might be:

1. The fact ("We've worked with the same farm for four years.")
2. The process ("Here's what happens between the farm and your cup.")
3. The question ("How much does it matter where your coffee comes from?")
4. The contrast ("Most cafés buy on the spot market. We don't.")
5. The human element ("There's a farmer named Pedro who texts us every February.")
6. The educational ("What 'direct trade' actually means vs. what it gets used to mean.")
7. The local angle ("Oaxacan beans. Montclair cups.")
8. The invitation ("Come ask us about it next time you're in.")
9. The opinion ("The relationship is the supply chain.")

Same subject. Nine distinct entries into the conversation.

## Common mistakes

- **Opening with "We are excited to..."** This phrase tells the reader nothing and signals that nothing interesting follows. Delete it. Start with the thing you're excited about.
- **Same caption on every platform.** If your Instagram caption and your Twitter caption are identical, you haven't written Twitter content — you've just shortened your Instagram caption.
- **Hashtag stuffing.** Twenty-five hashtags on an Instagram post signals spam to both the algorithm and the reader. Use 3–5 that are actually relevant.
- **No CTA.** Even "drop a comment" is better than nothing. Give readers somewhere to go.
- **Writing to the platform instead of to the person.** Your persona is Maya, a 27-year-old grad student. Write to her, not to "Instagram users."
