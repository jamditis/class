# February 26 — Campaign objectives, platform strategy, and content calendars

*Week 6 · Thursday*

---

## Overview

Today bridges the gap between audience research and creative production. You've built personas and research dossiers. Now: what are you actually going to *do* with that information? This class introduces the framework you'll use for the campaign strategy assignment (due Thu, Mar 5).

---

## 1. Bridge from Tuesday's personas session

Tuesday was the personas working session — you built 2–3 personas for your final project. Today shifts from *who your audience is* to *what you're going to do to reach them*.

The sequence so far: **Research dossier → Personas → Campaign strategy → Production.**

---

## 2. What a campaign strategy document is (and isn't)

A campaign strategy is the bridge between your research and your creative output. It answers: given everything you learned in the dossier and personas, what are you actually going to do?

- It's **1–2 pages, not a sprawling report.** Tight and specific.
- It uses this framework: **Goal → Strategies → Tactics → KPIs → CTAs**
- It forces decisions before production starts — which platforms, which audiences, what goals, how you'll measure success.

---

## 3. Setting a campaign goal

One sentence. One goal. A campaign that tries to do everything accomplishes nothing.

A goal names four things: **the audience, the outcome, a number, and a timeframe.**

**Weak goal:**
> Grow our Instagram following.

**Strong goal:**
> Increase awareness of Grounds for Change among MSU graduate students (ages 22–30) in Montclair, driving 40 new in-store visits from that segment by April 30.

The strong version names the audience, specifies the outcome (visits, not followers), includes a number, and sets a timeframe.

**Connection to personas:** Your persona tells you *who*. Your goal tells you *what you want them to do.*

---

## 4. Strategies vs. tactics

This is the distinction most students struggle with. Spend time on this.

- **Strategies = why and where.** Broad directional approaches. 2–4 per campaign.
- **Tactics = what and when.** Specific actions that execute each strategy.

**Example strategies:**

> **Strategy 1:** Build visibility on platforms where the target audience discovers new local places (Instagram, TikTok).
>
> **Strategy 2:** Create content that communicates our work-friendliness and coffee quality — the two things our audience cares about most.
>
> **Strategy 3:** Partner with MSU-adjacent accounts to reach students who aren't already following us.

**Example tactics (mapped to strategies above):**

> - Post 4x/week on Instagram: Tuesdays and Thursdays, Saturday community post, one behind-the-scenes post per week
> - Produce 2 TikToks per month: one educational and one showing the work environment
> - Run one 2-week paid Instagram promotion targeting Montclair + MSU zip codes, 22–30 demographic

**Common mistake:** Writing tactics and calling them strategies. "Post on Instagram three times a week" is a tactic. The strategy is *why* you're on Instagram, *what* you're communicating, and *to whom.*

## 5. Platform strategy — picking where to show up

You don't need to be everywhere. You need to be where **your persona actually spends time.**

Key questions for choosing platforms:

- Where does your target audience discover new things?
- What content format fits your organization's strengths?
- Can you realistically maintain a presence there?

**Platform behavior matters.** A content calendar that posts the same thing to Instagram and TikTok on the same day isn't a strategy — it's copy-paste. Each platform has different native formats, rhythms, and audience expectations.

### What works where (2026)

- **Instagram:** visual brand identity, carousels for education, Reels for reach, Stories for engagement
- **TikTok:** discovery, behind-the-scenes, personality, trend-riding
- **Twitter/X:** concise takes, news hooks, conversation
- **LinkedIn:** professional positioning, thought leadership
- **Email:** owned audience, direct CTAs, highest conversion

## 6. KPIs — how you'll know if it worked

KPIs = specific numbers tied to your goal. Not vibes. Numbers.

| Metric | Baseline (now) | Target (end of campaign) |
|--------|----------------|--------------------------|
| Instagram followers | 340 | 500 |
| Post engagement rate | 1.8% | 3.5% |
| New customer mentions in reviews | 2 in 3 months | 8 in 3 months |
| First-time visitors citing social media | No tracking | 15/month |

**Rules:**

- 3–5 KPIs max. More than that and you stop tracking all of them.
- You need a baseline. If you don't know where you're starting, you can't measure progress.
- Pick things you can actually measure. "Increase brand awareness" is not a KPI unless you define how you're measuring awareness.

---

## 7. CTAs — what you're asking people to do

Every piece of content needs a call to action. Define them upfront so they're consistent across the campaign.

Three levels:

- **Primary CTA:** the main thing you want (visit, buy, sign up)
- **Secondary CTA:** builds community or generates content (tag us, share your experience)
- **Engagement CTA:** drives algorithm and conversation (reply, poll, question)

Your CTAs should come directly from your goal. If your goal is in-store visits, your primary CTA is "come in," not "follow us."

---

## 8. Content calendars

A content calendar turns your strategy into a schedule. It answers: what are you posting, where, and when?

**Sample two-week calendar:**

| Date | Platform | Content type | Topic | CTA |
|------|----------|--------------|-------|-----|
| Mon Feb 24 | Instagram | Photo | Morning espresso bar setup | "Come see us before 9" |
| Tue Feb 25 | Instagram | Reel | How we dial in a new bean | "Tag a coffee person who gets it" |
| Wed Feb 26 | TikTok | Video | "What to order if you've never been" | "See you soon" |
| Thu Feb 27 | Instagram Stories | Poll | "Work from home or coffee shop?" | Reply with your answer |
| Sat Mar 1 | Instagram | Photo | Weekend crowd + natural light | "We're open till 5" |

**Key points:**

- Each post should map to a strategy and include a CTA
- Mix content types — don't post the same format every day
- Be realistic about frequency. Three posts a week you'll actually do beats daily posts you'll abandon by week two.
- The assignment asks for a **two-week sample** — enough to show you've thought about posting rhythm and platform mix

## Assignment reminder

**Campaign strategy due: Thursday, March 5** (75 pts)

Use the Goal → Strategies → Tactics → KPIs → CTAs framework. Include a two-week content calendar. Add it to your Google Drive folder — same link as the research dossier.
