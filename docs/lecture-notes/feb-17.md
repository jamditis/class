# February 17 — Final project kickoff and research dossier

*Week 5 · Tuesday*

---

## Key takeaways

- All remaining assignments build toward a single final project: a multimedia campaign for a real or fictional organization.
- The research dossier (or landscape scan) is the first deliverable — it maps the organization's ecosystem before any creative work begins.
- Choose a smaller organization or a hyper-specific campaign for a large one to avoid being overwhelmed by existing work.
- Create a shared Google Drive folder with "Anyone at Montclair State University can edit" permissions — submit that folder URL for all assignments going forward.

## Topics covered

### Final project overview

A cumulative campaign with all subsequent assignments as deliverables. The project is built piece by piece — each assignment adds a new layer.

### Project selection strategy

- **Avoid dominant brands** — Disney, Apple, the Knicks. Their existing marketing teams are too good; you'll struggle to find meaningful gaps.
- **Strong choices:** local businesses, community organizations, fictional brands, or a hyper-specific campaign for a larger brand (one product launch, one regional initiative).

### Research dossier content

What goes in the dossier:

- **Competitor analysis** — 3–5 competitors, their social media presence, pricing, and messaging
- **Audience analysis** — current vs. potential audience; who they are and what they need
- **SWOT analysis** — Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats
- **Inspiration** — content or campaigns that could inform your approach

### Example: Hammond Museum campaign

Walked through a real example — strategic goal, SMART objectives, audience funnel, CTAs. Showed how research translates into strategy.

### Google Drive setup

One shared folder per student. Submit the folder URL once — that same link covers all future assignments and gives the instructor editor access for inline feedback.
