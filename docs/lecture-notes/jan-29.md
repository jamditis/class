# January 29 — Cluetrain Manifesto discussion

*Week 2 · Thursday*

---

## Key takeaways

- The 1999 "Cluetrain Manifesto" was framed as a "95 Theses" for the digital age, challenging corporate communication norms.
- Getting a sense of humor "requires big values, a little humility, straight talk, and a genuine point of view" — not just jokes on a corporate website.
- The "corporate roast" trend on social media (e.g., Wendy's) is a superficial attempt at humor that fails to meet the manifesto's standard of genuine humility.
