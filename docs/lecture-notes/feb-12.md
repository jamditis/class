# February 12 — Slide design and final project overview

*Week 4 · Thursday*

---

## Key takeaways

- **Final project assigned:** A cumulative project to create a multimedia campaign for a real or fictional organization.
- **Strategic foundation:** The project requires a style guide, research dossier, customer personas, and a campaign strategy document before creative work begins.
- **Creative deliverables:** The campaign must include two written pieces, four social media graphics, and nine social media captions (three for Twitter to force conciseness).

## Topics covered

### Slide deck review and feedback

Student presentations reviewed with live feedback on design choices, hierarchy, and visual consistency.

### Final project: multimedia campaign

The final project was formally assigned. Key points:

- **Objective:** Create a multimedia campaign for a real or fictional entity
- **Strategy first:** You build the research and strategy documents before making anything visual
- **Required deliverables:**
  1. Style guide and branding kit
  2. Research dossier
  3. Customer/user personas (2–3)
  4. Campaign strategy document
  5. Two written pieces
  6. Two featured images (1200x630)
  7. Four social media graphics (1080x1080)
  8. Nine social media captions (three for Twitter)

### Project selection advice

Avoid dominant brands — their existing professional work makes it hard to find meaningful improvements. Strong choices: local businesses, community organizations, fictional brands, or hyper-specific campaigns for larger brands.
