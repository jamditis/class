# February 10 — Propaganda poster critique

*Week 4 · Tuesday*

---

## Key takeaways

- **Poster critique:** Designs were critiqued for poor hierarchy, excessive borders, and illegible text. Key advice: use the rule of thirds for clear focal points and align text left, not center.
- **New assignment:** Create a slide deck on a topic of your choice, due Thursday, to apply design principles to a multi-canvas project.
- **Final project:** Will be assigned Thursday, with spring break as a potential work period.

## Topics covered

### Propaganda poster critiques

Live critique of student work. Common issues identified:

- **Poor hierarchy** — when everything is the same size, the viewer's eye has nowhere to go
- **Excessive borders** — borders trap the design and waste space
- **Illegible text** — contrast matters for readability, not just aesthetics
- **Center alignment** — left-aligned text is easier to read; center alignment should be intentional, not default

### Key design advice

- **Rule of thirds:** place focal points at the intersection of grid lines
- **Alignment:** left-align body text; center alignment is for headlines and short phrases
- **Scale:** if something is important, make it big enough to be seen first

### New assignment: "Slide deck that doesn't suck"

Apply design principles to a multi-canvas project. 5-7 slides, minimal text, consistent visual style.
