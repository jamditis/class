# January 20 — Class expectations, student interests, and the final project

*Week 1 · Tuesday*

---

## Key takeaways

- **Final project:** Design a multimedia asset package for a cause or company. The project is worth ~40% of your grade (vs. 50–100 pts for assignments), making correct submission critical.
- **Submission policy:** All work must be shared via a Google Drive link with **editor access**. Incorrect permissions will result in a zero, as the instructor cannot grade inaccessible files.
- **Class philosophy:** Prioritize high-volume creation ("make dog ") to build skills and identify quality work, rather than aiming for perfection from the start.

## Topics covered

### Instructor's philosophy and background

Joe Amditis's career trajectory (from $4k grant recipient to Associate Director at $101k/yr) illustrates the value of basic tech competence. The theme: practical skills compound over time.

### Student interests and final project brainstorm

A "round the room" exercise revealed diverse student interests, which serve as potential topics for the final project. The goal: pick something you care about enough to work on all semester.

### Final project and class logistics

- **Final project:** A multimedia asset package for a chosen organization, campaign, or cause
- All subsequent assignments are deliverables that build toward the final project
- Submission via Google Drive with correct sharing permissions
