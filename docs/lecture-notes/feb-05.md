# February 5 — Design principles and slide design

*Week 3 · Thursday*

---

## Key takeaways

- Every visual choice (hierarchy, space, balance, contrast) is a strategic tool to guide a viewer's eye and convey a message.
- Presentation slides are visual aids for a speaker (minimal text, 6x6 rule), while "read-ahead" decks are standalone documents — never read presentation slides aloud.
- To fix a stuck slide design, try making a key image "big as hell" (dramatic focal point) or "a million tiny ones" (pattern/texture).

## Topics covered

### Hierarchy

Guides the eye to the most important information first, using size, prominence, and color. If everything is the same size, nothing is important.

### Space (whitespace)

Creates focus and a clean, modern feel. Don't fill every inch of the canvas — let elements breathe.

### Balance and symmetry

Creates a sense of order. Can be symmetrical (formal, stable) or asymmetrical (dynamic, interesting).

### Contrast

Creates visual interest and emphasizes differences. Light vs. dark, big vs. small, serif vs. sans-serif.

### Rhythm and repetition

Creates movement or unity through recurring elements (motifs). A repeating visual element ties a design together.

### Slide design best practices

- **6x6 rule:** no more than 6 words per line, 6 lines per slide
- Use presenter notes for detail — the slide is the visual aid, not the script
- Avoid GIFs in professional presentations
- When stuck on layout, troubleshoot with scale: make one thing huge or repeat one thing many times

### Homework

Alien propaganda poster — design an 8.5" x 11" vertical poster for an alien society using these principles (due Feb 10).
