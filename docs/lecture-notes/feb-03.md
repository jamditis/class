# February 3 — AI tools and assignment submission

*Week 3 · Tuesday*

---

## Key takeaways

- Submit Google Doc/Drive links immediately when an assignment is released — the link is static, so you can keep working until grading begins ("Schrodinger's Document" strategy).
- Sloppy AI use (unformatted text, generic phrasing) is immediately identifiable and unacceptable — use AI to augment skills, not replace them.
- Recommended AI tools: Gemini (best value via Google One), Claude (best for technical tasks), ChatGPT (least recommended for this class).

## Topics covered

### Submission format

Google Docs and Google Drive folders required. Treat assignments as professional deliverables — formatting, structure, and presentation matter.

### Late submissions

Assignments open for ~2 days post-deadline with a point deduction. Extensions available if you ask before the due date.

### AI usage policy

- **Allowed:** research, note-taking, structuring, brainstorming
- **Not allowed:** generating final creative work
- The distinction: AI should help you think, not think for you

### Canva Pro setup

Apply for a free education account using your .edu email. You'll need it for upcoming design assignments.

### Upcoming assignments

- Alien propaganda poster (in-class)
- "Slide deck that doesn't suck" (weekend)
