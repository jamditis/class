# February 24 — Customer/user personas working session

*Week 6 · Tuesday*

---

## Key takeaways

- **Customer personas are semi-fictional archetypes** of your target customer, built from data, experience, and intuition — the goal is to get inside their head, not just list demographics.
- **You need 2–3 personas for the final project** to validate that your campaign features and content actually serve your audience. Every new asset you add should be checked against these personas.
- **Research dossier deadline was for submitting the URL**, not the completed dossier. Eight students have a zero for a missing assignment. The dossier is still a required component of the final project.

## Topics covered

### Research dossier grades

The deadline policy: submitting the URL is the milestone, not finishing the document. This mirrors real collaborative workflows — the link is static, the content evolves.

### Personas: definition and purpose

What to include in a persona:

- **Demographics** — but go beyond age and location
- **Pain points** — financial constraints, commuting, poor Wi-Fi, time pressure
- **Daily routine** — when and where do they encounter your organization?
- **Media habits** — what platforms, what time of day, what content format?
- **Goals and motivations** — what are they trying to accomplish?

### Strategic application

Use personas to validate campaign features. Example: a coffee shop targeting college students highlights Wi-Fi speed and study spaces, not just coffee quality. The persona tells you what to emphasize.

### In-class workshop

35 minutes building personas for the final project. The exercise: pick one customer type and write their bio, daily schedule, goals, and pain points.

### New class resource page

A supplemental page with expanded assignment breakdowns, examples, common mistakes, and lecture recordings. Always defer to Canvas for official deadlines and grades.
