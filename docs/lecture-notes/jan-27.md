# January 27 — Information needs and the shiny new thing

*Week 2 · Tuesday*

---

## Topics covered

### Information needs

How people seek, evaluate, and use information — and why that matters for strategic communications.

### Enshittification and platform decay

Cory Doctorow's framework for how platforms degrade over time: first they're good to users, then they abuse users to benefit business customers, then they abuse everyone to extract value for shareholders.

### The "shiny new thing"

Why chasing the latest platform or tool is a trap. Focus on fundamentals — writing, design, strategy — that transfer across platforms.
