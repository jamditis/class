## Lecture summaries

AI-generated summaries from class recordings, reviewed for accuracy. Use these for review or if you missed a session.

### Feb 17 — To kick off the final project and define the initial research phase

**Key takeaways:**
- **Final Project:** All assignments from now on contribute to a single final project: creating a multimedia campaign for a real or fictional organization.
- **Research Dossier:** The first deliverable is a Research Dossier (or Landscape Scan) to map the organization's ecosystem (competitors, audience, gaps) and inform the campaign strategy.
- **Strategic Focus:** Choose a smaller organization or a hyper-specific campaign for a large one. This avoids being overwhelmed by existing work and allows for more creative impact.

**Topics covered:**
- **Final Project Overview** — The final project is a cumulative campaign for a real or fictional organization.
- **Project Selection Strategy** — **Avoid Dominant Brands (e.g., Apple, Disney):**
- **Research Dossier (Landscape Scan)** — **Purpose:** To map the organization's ecosystem and identify strategic opportunities.
- **Example: Hammond Museum Campaign** — **Organization:** Hammond Museum and Japanese Stroll Garden (real, local).
- **Google Drive Setup & Submission** — **Process:**
- **Syllabus & Communication Updates** — **Syllabus:** Being updated to reflect the new assignment structure.

### Feb 12 — Slide design and final project overview

**Key takeaways:**
- **Final Project Assigned:** A cumulative project to create a multimedia campaign for a real or fictional organization.
- **Strategic Foundation:** The project requires a Style Guide, Research Dossier, Customer Personas, and a Campaign Strategy document before creative work begins.
- **Creative Deliverables:** The campaign must include two written pieces, four social media graphics, and nine social media captions (three for Twitter to force conciseness).

**Topics covered:**
- **Slide Deck Review & Feedback** — **River's Presentation (Lizzie McAlpine):**
- **Final Project: Multimedia Campaign** — **Objective:** Create a multimedia campaign for a real or fictional entity.

### Feb 10 — Critique propaganda posters and introduce the next assignment

**Key takeaways:**
- **Poster Critique:** Designs were critiqued for poor hierarchy, excessive borders, and illegible text. Key advice: use the rule of thirds for clear focal points and align text left, not center.
- **New Assignment:** Create a 10-slide deck on a "nonsensical" topic, due Thursday, to apply design principles to a multi-canvas project.
- **Final Project:** The final project will be assigned Thursday, with spring break (starts March 8) as a potential work period.

**Topics covered:**
- **Propaganda Poster Critiques** — **"Crush Their Nuts" Poster**
- **New Assignment: "Create a Slide Deck That Doesn't Suck"** — **Objective:** Apply design principles to a multi-canvas project (10 slides).

### Feb 5 — Design principles and slide design

**Key takeaways:**
- Every visual choice (hierarchy, space, balance, contrast) is a strategic tool to guide a viewer's eye and convey a message
- Presentation slides are visual aids for a speaker (minimal text, 6x6 rule), while "read-ahead" decks are standalone documents — never read presentation slides aloud
- To fix a stuck slide design, try making a key image "big as hell" (dramatic focal point) or "a million tiny ones" (pattern/texture)

**Topics covered:**
- **Hierarchy** — guides the eye to the most important information first, using size, prominence, and color
- **Space (whitespace)** — creates focus and a clean, modern feel
- **Balance and symmetry** — creates a sense of order
- **Contrast** — creates visual interest and emphasizes differences
- **Rhythm and repetition** — creates movement or unity through recurring elements (motifs)
- **Slide design best practices** — 6x6 rule, use presenter notes, avoid GIFs, troubleshoot with scale
- **Homework: alien propaganda poster** — design an 8.5" x 11" vertical poster for an alien society using these principles (due Feb 10)

---

### Feb 3 — AI tools and assignment submission

**Key takeaways:**
- Submit Google Doc/Drive links immediately when an assignment is released — the link is static, so you can keep working until grading begins ("Schrödinger's Document" strategy)
- Sloppy AI use (unformatted text, generic phrasing) is immediately identifiable and unacceptable — use AI to augment skills, not replace them
- Recommended AI tools: Gemini (best value via Google One), Claude (best for technical tasks), ChatGPT (least recommended for this class)

**Topics covered:**
- **Submission format** — Google Docs and Google Drive folders required; treat assignments as professional deliverables
- **Late submissions** — assignments open for ~2 days post-deadline with a point deduction
- **AI usage policy** — allowed for research, note-taking, structuring; disallowed for generating final creative work
- **Canva Pro setup** — apply for free education account using your .edu email
- **Upcoming assignments** — alien propaganda poster (in-class) and "slide deck that doesn't suck" (weekend)

### Jan 29 — Cluetrain manifesto discussion

**Key takeaways:**
- The 1999 "Cluetrain Manifesto" was framed as a "95 Thesis" for the digital age, challenging corporate communication norms
- Getting a sense of humor "requires big values, a little humility, straight talk, and a genuine point of view" — not just jokes on a corporate website
- The "corporate roast" trend on social media (e.g., Wendy's) is a superficial attempt at humor that fails to meet the manifesto's standard of genuine humility

**Topics covered:**
- **AI-generated slide decks** — NotebookLM can create slide decks from lecture transcripts (QR codes don't work yet, but content is accurate)
- **Content distribution** — recordings posted via Canvas Discussions to trigger email notifications (bypasses 50MB file upload limit)
- **Cluetrain discussion** — thesis #20-22 on companies needing to lighten up and take themselves less seriously
- **Keyboard shortcut stickers** — given as rewards for strong discussion answers

---

### Jan 22 — Introduction and digital literacy

**Key takeaways:**
- The syllabus is the primary guide, but Canvas Announcements are the definitive source for updates
- Treat your computer as a personal tool to be customized, not a fragile machine — mastering shortcuts signals advanced digital literacy to employers
- Install a password manager, ad blocker (uBlock Origin), and tab manager (OneTab) as essential browser extensions

**Topics covered:**
- **"Mountain of principle"** — the core philosophy is to create and experiment without fear of imperfection
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — copy, cut, paste, new tab, reopen closed tab, switch applications, jump to address bar
- **Essential browser extensions** — password manager, uBlock Origin, OneTab, CopyClip (Mac), Grammarly, Video Speed Controller, Greenshot
- **File types** — plain text (.txt), markdown (.md), and HTML (.html)
- **First assignment** — read the "95 Theses of the Cluetrain Manifesto" and the Josh Topolsky article
