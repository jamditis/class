## Lecture summaries

AI-generated summaries from class recordings, reviewed for accuracy. Use these for review or if you missed a session.

### Jan 20 — Class expectations, student interests, and the final project

**Key takeaways:**
- **Final Project:** Design a multimedia asset package for a cause or company. The project is worth 500 points (vs. 50–100 for assignments), making correct submission critical.
- **Submission Policy:** All work must be shared via a Google Drive link with **Editor access**. Incorrect permissions will result in a zero, as the instructor cannot grade inaccessible files.
- **Class Philosophy:** Prioritize high-volume creation ("make dog ") to build skills and identify quality work, rather than aiming for perfection from the start.

**Topics covered:**
- **Instructor's Philosophy & Background** — Joe Amditis's career trajectory (from $4k grant recipient to Associate Director at $101k/yr) illustrates the value of basic tech competence.
- **Student Interests & Final Project Brainstorm** — A "round the room" exercise revealed diverse student interests, which serve as potential topics for the final project.
- **Final Project & Class Logistics** — **Final Project:** A multimedia asset package for a chosen organization, campaign, or cause.

### Feb 24 — Customer/user personas working session

**Key takeaways:**
- **Customer personas are semi-fictional archetypes** of your target customer, built from data, experience, and intuition — the goal is to get inside their head, not just list demographics.
- **You need 2–3 personas for the final project** to validate that your campaign features and content actually serve your audience. Every new asset you add should be checked against these personas.
- **Research Dossier deadline was for submitting the URL**, not the completed dossier. Eight students have a zero for a missing assignment. The dossier is still a required component of the final project.

**Topics covered:**
- **Research Dossier grades** — the deadline policy: submitting the URL is the milestone, not finishing the document. This mirrors real collaborative workflows.
- **Personas: definition and purpose** — what to include: demographics, pain points (financial constraints, commuting, poor Wi-Fi), daily routine, media habits, goals and motivations.
- **Strategic application** — use personas to validate campaign features. Example: a coffee shop targeting college students highlights Wi-Fi speed and study spaces, not just coffee quality.
- **In-class workshop** — 35 minutes building personas for the final project. Verified sources and templates sent after class.
- **New class resource page** — a supplemental page with expanded assignment breakdowns, examples, common mistakes, and lecture recordings. Always defer to Canvas for official deadlines and grades.

### Feb 26 — Pulling it all together to create your campaign strategy

**Key takeaways:**
- **Personas need depth** — go beyond demographics to include material conditions (finances, transit access, childcare) and specific digital habits (social follows, comment patterns). Treat persona-building as "data-driven role-playing."
- **Strategy guides tactics** — a campaign strategy is a short guiding document, not a task list. The flow is: goal → strategies → tactics → KPIs → messaging/CTAs.
- **KPIs must be specific** — focus on 3–5 metrics tracking real business outcomes (sales conversions), not vanity metrics like impressions or follower counts. More than 5 and you stop tracking all of them.
- **Content calendars require caution** — pre-scheduled content can become irrelevant or tone-deaf when news breaks. This failure mode is called "tombstoning" (a funeral home ad appearing next to a story about a child's death).

**Topics covered:**
- **Customer persona feedback** — reviewed student work including a Dave & Buster's persona; the goal is to capture what customers actually want (e.g., an adult-focused, child-free environment), not just the company's preferred brand image
- **Campaign strategy document structure** — five sections: overview (who is the org, what are its values), goal (one specific sentence with a measurable outcome), strategies (2–4 directional approaches), tactics (specific actions mapped to each strategy), KPIs (3–5 metrics), and messaging/CTAs
- **Content calendars and "tombstoning"** — useful for planning campaign progression, but scheduled posts can become irrelevant or controversial without real-time monitoring; the Applebee's military discount ad example illustrated the risk

### Feb 19 — Final project topic strategy

**Key takeaways:**
- Avoid large, established brands (Knicks, Air Jordan) for the final project — their existing marketing makes finding impactful improvements difficult
- Focus on small-to-medium businesses (SMBs) with clear growth potential — you can apply strategic skills to create tangible, measurable improvements
- The Research Dossier is a living document. The first submission (due Tuesday) is a low-stakes check for direction, not a final draft
- Use the class's AI tools (slide decks, NotebookLM) to review material, find citations, and generate mind maps

**Topics covered:**
- **Final project selection** — three options: hyper-niche campaign for a large brand, creating a new brand, or (recommended) an SMB
- **Research Dossier** — first submission due Tuesday; share as a Google Doc with editor access; 35 points for completion/direction
- **Customer personas** — core dossier component: bio, daily schedule, goals and pain points, and how they interact with your product
- **Class resources** — slide decks, NotebookLM for AI-generated mind maps and Q&A from transcripts, office hours via Canvas

---

### Feb 17 — Final project kickoff and research dossier

**Key takeaways:**
- All remaining assignments build toward a single final project: a multimedia campaign for a real or fictional organization
- The Research Dossier (or Landscape Scan) is the first deliverable — it maps the organization's ecosystem before any creative work begins
- Choose a smaller organization or a hyper-specific campaign for a large one to avoid being overwhelmed by existing work
- Create a shared Google Drive folder with "Anyone at Montclair State University can edit" permissions — submit that folder URL for all assignments

**Topics covered:**
- **Final project overview** — cumulative campaign with all subsequent assignments as deliverables
- **Project selection strategy** — avoid dominant brands; choose local/fictional orgs or hyper-specific campaigns
- **Research Dossier content** — competitor analysis, audience analysis (current vs. potential), SWOT analysis
- **Example: Hammond Museum Campaign** — strategic goal, SMART objectives, audience funnel, CTAs
- **Google Drive setup** — one shared folder per student, submitted URL grants editor access for feedback

---

### Feb 12 — Slide design and final project overview

**Key takeaways:**
- **Final Project Assigned:** A cumulative project to create a multimedia campaign for a real or fictional organization.
- **Strategic Foundation:** The project requires a Style Guide, Research Dossier, Customer Personas, and a Campaign Strategy document before creative work begins.
- **Creative Deliverables:** The campaign must include two written pieces, four social media graphics, and nine social media captions (three for Twitter to force conciseness).

**Topics covered:**
- **Slide Deck Review & Feedback** — **River's Presentation (Lizzie McAlpine):**
- **Final Project: Multimedia Campaign** — **Objective:** Create a multimedia campaign for a real or fictional entity.

### Feb 10 — Critique propaganda posters and introduce the next assignment

**Key takeaways:**
- **Poster Critique:** Designs were critiqued for poor hierarchy, excessive borders, and illegible text. Key advice: use the rule of thirds for clear focal points and align text left, not center.
- **New Assignment:** Create a 10-slide deck on a "nonsensical" topic, due Thursday, to apply design principles to a multi-canvas project.
- **Final Project:** The final project will be assigned Thursday, with spring break (starts March 8) as a potential work period.

**Topics covered:**
- **Propaganda Poster Critiques** — **"Crush Their Nuts" Poster**
- **New Assignment: "Create a Slide Deck That Doesn't Suck"** — **Objective:** Apply design principles to a multi-canvas project (10 slides).

---

### Feb 5 — Design principles and slide design

**Key takeaways:**
- Every visual choice (hierarchy, space, balance, contrast) is a strategic tool to guide a viewer's eye and convey a message
- Presentation slides are visual aids for a speaker (minimal text, 6x6 rule), while "read-ahead" decks are standalone documents — never read presentation slides aloud
- To fix a stuck slide design, try making a key image "big as hell" (dramatic focal point) or "a million tiny ones" (pattern/texture)

**Topics covered:**
- **Hierarchy** — guides the eye to the most important information first, using size, prominence, and color
- **Space (whitespace)** — creates focus and a clean, modern feel
- **Balance and symmetry** — creates a sense of order
- **Contrast** — creates visual interest and emphasizes differences
- **Rhythm and repetition** — creates movement or unity through recurring elements (motifs)
- **Slide design best practices** — 6x6 rule, use presenter notes, avoid GIFs, troubleshoot with scale
- **Homework: alien propaganda poster** — design an 8.5" x 11" vertical poster for an alien society using these principles (due Feb 10)

---

### Feb 3 — AI tools and assignment submission

**Key takeaways:**
- Submit Google Doc/Drive links immediately when an assignment is released — the link is static, so you can keep working until grading begins ("Schrödinger's Document" strategy)
- Sloppy AI use (unformatted text, generic phrasing) is immediately identifiable and unacceptable — use AI to augment skills, not replace them
- Recommended AI tools: Gemini (best value via Google One), Claude (best for technical tasks), ChatGPT (least recommended for this class)

**Topics covered:**
- **Submission format** — Google Docs and Google Drive folders required; treat assignments as professional deliverables
- **Late submissions** — assignments open for ~2 days post-deadline with a point deduction
- **AI usage policy** — allowed for research, note-taking, structuring; disallowed for generating final creative work
- **Canva Pro setup** — apply for free education account using your .edu email
- **Upcoming assignments** — alien propaganda poster (in-class) and "slide deck that doesn't suck" (weekend)

---

### Jan 29 — Cluetrain manifesto discussion

**Key takeaways:**
- The 1999 "Cluetrain Manifesto" was framed as a "95 Thesis" for the digital age, challenging corporate communication norms
- Getting a sense of humor "requires big values, a little humility, straight talk, and a genuine point of view" — not just jokes on a corporate website
- The "corporate roast" trend on social media (e.g., Wendy's) is a superficial attempt at humor that fails to meet the manifesto's standard of genuine humility

**Topics covered:**
- **AI-generated slide decks** — NotebookLM can create slide decks from lecture transcripts (QR codes don't work yet, but content is accurate)
- **Content distribution** — recordings posted via Canvas Discussions to trigger email notifications (bypasses 50MB file upload limit)
- **Cluetrain discussion** — thesis #20-22 on companies needing to lighten up and take themselves less seriously
- **Keyboard shortcut stickers** — given as rewards for strong discussion answers

---

### Jan 22 — Introduction and digital literacy

**Key takeaways:**
- The syllabus is the primary guide, but Canvas Announcements are the definitive source for updates
- Treat your computer as a personal tool to be customized, not a fragile machine — mastering shortcuts signals advanced digital literacy to employers
- Install a password manager, ad blocker (uBlock Origin), and tab manager (OneTab) as essential browser extensions

**Topics covered:**
- **"Mountain of principle"** — the core philosophy is to create and experiment without fear of imperfection
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — copy, cut, paste, new tab, reopen closed tab, switch applications, jump to address bar
- **Essential browser extensions** — password manager, uBlock Origin, OneTab, CopyClip (Mac), Grammarly, Video Speed Controller, Greenshot
- **File types** — plain text (.txt), markdown (.md), and HTML (.html)
- **First assignment** — read the "95 Theses of the Cluetrain Manifesto" and the Josh Topolsky article
