## Assignment descriptions

### Read the Cluetrain Manifesto (25 pts)
**Due:** Thursday, January 29

Read the "95 Theses of the Cluetrain Manifesto" and come prepared to discuss its relevance to modern media and strategic communications.

---

### Cluetrain Manifesto media analysis (35 pts)
**Due:** Tuesday, February 3 at 10:00 AM (before class)

Find a piece of media that is relevant to the Cluetrain Manifesto and analyze how it connects to the document's core ideas.

**Instructions:**

1. **Find a piece of media** — This could be an article, advertisement, social media post, video, podcast episode, company announcement, or any other piece of content that relates to the themes in the Cluetrain Manifesto.

2. **Identify the relevant thesis/theses** — Reference the specific item(s) from the 95 theses that your media example connects to. You can cite by number (e.g., "Thesis #7" or "Theses #12-14").

3. **Analyze the connection** — In 1-2 paragraphs, explain:
   - How does this media example relate to the thesis/theses you identified?
   - Does this example illustrate that the principle still holds true 27 years after the manifesto was published (1999), or does it suggest the claim no longer resonates?
   - Why do you think this is the case?

**Submission:**
- Submit via **Canvas text entry** (not a file upload)
- Include a link to your media example
- 1-2 paragraphs (approximately 150-300 words)

**Grading criteria:**
- Clear connection to specific thesis/theses (10 pts)
- Thoughtful analysis of relevance in 2026 (10 pts)
- Writing clarity and mechanics (5 pts)

**Tips:**
- The manifesto was written in 1999, at the dawn of the commercial internet
- Consider how markets, companies, and conversations have changed (or haven't)
- Strong submissions will go beyond surface-level observations to analyze *why* the principle does or doesn't hold up

### Alien planet travel poster (50 pts)
**Due:** Thursday, February 19
