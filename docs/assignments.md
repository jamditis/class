## Assignment descriptions

### Read the Cluetrain Manifesto (25 pts)

**Due:** Thursday, January 29

Read the "95 Theses of the Cluetrain Manifesto" and come prepared to discuss its relevance to modern media and strategic communications.

---

### Cluetrain Manifesto media analysis (25 pts)

**Due:** Tuesday, February 3 at 10:00 AM (before class)

Find a piece of media that is relevant to the Cluetrain Manifesto and analyze how it connects to the document's core ideas.

**Instructions:**

1. **Find a piece of media** — This could be an article, advertisement, social media post, video, podcast episode, company announcement, or any other piece of content that relates to the themes in the Cluetrain Manifesto.

2. **Identify the relevant thesis/theses** — Reference the specific item(s) from the 95 theses that your media example connects to. You can cite by number (e.g., "Thesis #7" or "Theses #12-14").

3. **Analyze the connection** — In 1-2 paragraphs, explain:
   - How does this media example relate to the thesis/theses you identified?
   - Does this example illustrate that the principle still holds true 27 years after the manifesto was published (1999), or does it suggest the claim no longer resonates?
   - Why do you think this is the case?

**Submission:**

- Submit via **Canvas text entry** (not a file upload)
- Include a link to your media example
- 1-2 paragraphs (approximately 150-300 words)

**Grading criteria:**

- Clear connection to specific thesis/theses (10 pts)
- Thoughtful analysis of relevance in 2026 (10 pts)
- Writing clarity and mechanics (5 pts)

**Tips:**

- The manifesto was written in 1999, at the dawn of the commercial internet
- Consider how markets, companies, and conversations have changed (or haven't)
- Strong submissions will go beyond surface-level observations to analyze *why* the principle does or doesn't hold up

### Design a slide deck that doesn't suck (50 pts)

**Due:** Tuesday, February 17

Create a 5-7 slide presentation on a topic of your choice that demonstrates strong design principles: visual hierarchy, contrast, alignment, and restraint.

- High-quality images or graphics
- Present to class during Week 4

### Alien propaganda poster (50 pts)

**Due:** Tuesday, February 10 at 10:00 AM (before class)

Design an 8.5" x 11" vertical propaganda poster for a fictional alien society. You are the chief propagandist for an alien government — your job is to persuade the residents of your planet using the design principles we covered in class.

**The scenario:**

Invent an alien planet with its own name, government, and social structure. Then create a poster that communicates a specific persuasive message to the planet's residents. This could be a recruitment ad, a public safety announcement, a loyalty campaign, a call to action — anything that a government might use to influence its citizens.

**Requirements:**

1. **World-building** — Give your alien planet a name, a type of government, and a reason for the propaganda. What are you trying to convince residents to do, believe, or feel?

2. **Content** — Your poster must include:
   - A catchy slogan or headline
   - At least one original symbol or logo for your alien society
   - Supporting text (a sentence or two that reinforces the message)

3. **Design principles** — Demonstrate what we covered in class:
   - **Hierarchy** — Guide the viewer's eye to the most important information first
   - **Contrast** — Use color, size, or weight to create visual interest and emphasis
   - **Recurring motif** — Include at least one repeating visual element that ties the design together

4. **Format** — 8.5" x 11" vertical orientation. Submit as a PNG or PDF.

5. **Tools** — Use whatever you want: Canva, Photoshop, Figma, Illustrator, hand-drawn and scanned, AI image generators — your call. If you use AI tools, you still need to make intentional design decisions about layout, hierarchy, and composition.

**Grading criteria:**

- Clear persuasive message and world-building (10 pts)
- Effective use of hierarchy and contrast (15 pts)
- Original symbol/logo and recurring motif (10 pts)
- Overall visual quality and cohesion (10 pts)
- Correct format and on-time submission (5 pts)

**Extra credit (5 pts):**

You can earn up to 5 extra credit points by doing one or both of the following:
- **Present your poster** in class for a live critique
- **Submit a written breakdown** of your design decisions — explain what principles you used, what choices you made, and why

**Submission:**

Submit via **Canvas** before 10:00 AM on Tuesday, February 10. Upload your poster as a PNG or PDF file.
