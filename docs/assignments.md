## Assignment descriptions

### Read the Cluetrain Manifesto (25 pts)

**Due:** Thursday, January 29

Read the "95 Theses of the Cluetrain Manifesto" and come prepared to discuss its relevance to modern media and strategic communications.

---

### Cluetrain Manifesto media analysis (35 pts)

**Due:** Tuesday, February 3 at 10:00 AM (before class)

Find a piece of media that is relevant to the Cluetrain Manifesto and analyze how it connects to the document's core ideas.

**Instructions:**

1. **Find a piece of media** — This could be an article, advertisement, social media post, video, podcast episode, company announcement, or any other piece of content that relates to the themes in the Cluetrain Manifesto.

2. **Identify the relevant thesis/theses** — Reference the specific item(s) from the 95 theses that your media example connects to. You can cite by number (e.g., "Thesis #7" or "Theses #12-14").

3. **Analyze the connection** — In 1-2 paragraphs, explain:
   - How does this media example relate to the thesis/theses you identified?
   - Does this example illustrate that the principle still holds true 27 years after the manifesto was published (1999), or does it suggest the claim no longer resonates?
   - Why do you think this is the case?

**Submission:**

- Submit via **Canvas text entry** (not a file upload)
- Include a link to your media example
- 1-2 paragraphs (approximately 150-300 words)

**Grading criteria:**

- Clear connection to specific thesis/theses (10 pts)
- Thoughtful analysis of relevance in 2026 (10 pts)
- Writing clarity and mechanics (5 pts)

**Tips:**

- The manifesto was written in 1999, at the dawn of the commercial internet
- Consider how markets, companies, and conversations have changed (or haven't)
- Strong submissions will go beyond surface-level observations to analyze *why* the principle does or doesn't hold up

---

### Design a slide deck that doesn't suck (50 pts)

**Due:** Thursday, February 12

Create a 5-7 slide presentation on a topic of your choice that demonstrates strong design principles: visual hierarchy, contrast, alignment, and restraint.

**Requirements:**

- 5-7 slides maximum
- Minimal text (no paragraphs)
- Consistent visual style
- High-quality images or graphics
- Present to class during Week 4

---

### Alien propaganda poster (50 pts)

**Due:** Tuesday, February 10 at 10:00 AM (before class)

Design an 8.5" x 11" vertical propaganda poster for a fictional alien society. You are the chief propagandist for an alien government — your job is to persuade the residents of your planet using the design principles we covered in class.

**The scenario:**

Invent an alien planet with its own name, government, and social structure. Then create a poster that communicates a specific persuasive message to the planet's residents. This could be a recruitment ad, a public safety announcement, a loyalty campaign, a call to action — anything that a government might use to influence its citizens.

**Requirements:**

1. **World-building** — Give your alien planet a name, a type of government, and a reason for the propaganda. What are you trying to convince residents to do, believe, or feel?

2. **Content** — Your poster must include:
   - A catchy slogan or headline
   - At least one original symbol or logo for your alien society
   - Supporting text (a sentence or two that reinforces the message)

3. **Design principles** — Demonstrate what we covered in class:
   - **Hierarchy** — Guide the viewer's eye to the most important information first
   - **Contrast** — Use color, size, or weight to create visual interest and emphasis
   - **Recurring motif** — Include at least one repeating visual element that ties the design together

4. **Format** — 8.5" x 11" vertical orientation. Submit as a PNG or PDF.

5. **Tools** — Use whatever you want: Canva, Photoshop, Figma, Illustrator, hand-drawn and scanned, AI image generators — your call. If you use AI tools, you still need to make intentional design decisions about layout, hierarchy, and composition.

**Grading criteria:**

- Clear persuasive message and world-building (10 pts)
- Effective use of hierarchy and contrast (15 pts)
- Original symbol/logo and recurring motif (10 pts)
- Overall visual quality and cohesion (10 pts)
- Correct format and on-time submission (5 pts)

**Extra credit (5 pts):**

You can earn up to 5 extra credit points by doing one or both of the following:
- **Present your poster** in class for a live critique
- **Submit a written breakdown** of your design decisions — explain what principles you used, what choices you made, and why

**Submission:**

Submit via **Canvas** before 10:00 AM on Tuesday, February 10. Upload your poster as a PNG or PDF file.

### Research dossier (35 pts)

**Due:** Tuesday, February 24

The Research Dossier is your project's living research document — a structured scratchpad where you gather everything about your organization: competitors, audience, trends, gaps, and inspiration. The first submission is a low-stakes check for direction, not a final draft. You'll continue building it throughout the semester.

**Choose your organization first.** If you haven't picked one yet, here's what works well:

- A small-to-medium business (local coffee shop, bakery, gym) that's good at what it does but weak on marketing
- A local or community organization (a theater, a non-profit, a community group)
- A fictional brand you create from scratch
- A hyper-specific campaign for a larger brand (one product launch, one regional initiative)

Avoid large dominant brands (Disney, Apple, the Knicks) — their existing professional work is overwhelming and limits your creative freedom. If you're unsure whether your choice works, come to office hours or reply to this assignment.

**What to include:**

- **Competitor analysis** — 3-5 competitors or comparable organizations, covering social media presence, pricing, and key messaging
- **Audience analysis** — current vs. potential audience; who they are and what they need
- **SWOT analysis** — Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats
- **Inspiration** — content or campaigns that could inform your approach
- **Customer persona(s)** — at least one draft persona: a short bio, typical day/schedule, goals, and pain points

**Submission:**

Share your Google Doc as **"Anyone with the link can edit"** and submit the link via Canvas. You do not need to uncheck "Notify people" for this one — the point of editor access is so I can leave inline comments.

**Grading:**

This submission is graded on completion and general direction (35 points), not on the quality or depth of the final content. Show me you've picked an organization and started gathering research.

### Campaign strategy (75 pts)

**Due:** Thursday, March 5

Write a 2-3 page strategic document outlining how your organization would deploy the assets you've created.

**Include:**

- **Campaign goal:** What are you trying to achieve?
- **Target audience:** Who are you reaching? Describe your intended audience based on your research dossier findings.
- **Platform strategy:** Where will these assets live and why?
- **Content calendar:** A two-week sample showing when and where each asset type would be posted
- **Success metrics:** How will you measure whether this worked?

---

### User/customer persona (75 pts)

**Due:** Thursday, March 19

Develop a detailed customer/user persona for your final project organization.

**Requirements:**

- Demographic information
- Psychographic profile (values, interests, pain points)
- Media consumption habits
- Goals and challenges
- How your organization serves their needs

---

### Critical copywriting (100 pts)

**Due:** Thursday, March 26

Write 3 pieces of copy using a "solutions lens" — critiquing industry problems while offering constructive alternatives.

**Requirements:**

- 3 distinct pieces (social post, email, blog intro)
- Each addresses a real problem in your field
- Maintains professional, constructive tone
- Demonstrates clear voice and perspective

---

### Featured images + social graphics (75 pts)

**Due:** Thursday, April 9

Create a cohesive set of visual assets for your final project organization.

**Deliverables:**

- **3 featured images** for blog posts/articles (1200x630 pixels)
- **3 social media graphics** (1080x1080 pixels)

**Requirements:**

- Consistent branding (colors, fonts, visual style)
- Proper alt text descriptions for all images
- Export-ready for web (PNG or JPEG, optimized file size)

## Final project: Multimedia campaign (~40%)

**Due:** Monday, May 4

Create a multimedia campaign for a real or fictional organization. All assignments from here on are deliverables for this project — you're building it piece by piece throughout the semester.

**Choose your organization wisely.** Avoid large, dominant brands (Disney, Apple, the Knicks) — their existing professional work is too high a bar to compete with and limits your creative freedom. Strong options:

- A small-to-medium business (local coffee shop, bakery, gym) that's good at what it does but weak on marketing
- A local or niche organization (a theater, a community group, a non-profit)
- A fictional brand you invent from scratch
- A hyper-specific campaign for a large brand (e.g., one product launch or one regional initiative)

**Required deliverables:**

1. **Style guide and branding kit** — A detailed manual with specific rules for fonts, colors (primary and secondary palettes), tone, grammar, and design elements. Goal: anyone following the guide could post for the company without the audience noticing a difference. [More details about this deliverable.]({{ site.baseurl }}/deliverables/style-guide)

2. **Research dossier** — Your living internal document: competitor analysis, audience analysis, SWOT, and inspiration. (Built throughout the semester.) [More details about this deliverable.]({{ site.baseurl }}/deliverables/research-dossier)

3. **Customer/user personas** — 2–3 fictional profiles of ideal customers, each with a bio, typical day, goals, and pain points. These lead directly to campaign ideas. [More details about this deliverable.]({{ site.baseurl }}/deliverables/personas)

4. **Campaign strategy document** — A 1–2 page plan structured as: Goal → Strategies → Tactics → KPIs (success metrics) → CTAs (calls to action). [More details about this deliverable.]({{ site.baseurl }}/deliverables/campaign-strategy)

5. **Two written pieces** — One must be a "call-out" piece: identify an industry problem, explain its impact, and highlight brands doing it right. [More details about this deliverable.]({{ site.baseurl }}/deliverables/written-pieces)

6. **Two featured images** — Graphics for blog post social previews (1200×630 pixels). These boost click-through rates when your posts appear in social feeds. [More details about this deliverable.]({{ site.baseurl }}/deliverables/featured-images)

7. **Four social media graphics** — Standalone images for direct posting (1080×1080 pixels). Must be visually compelling on their own. [More details about this deliverable.]({{ site.baseurl }}/deliverables/social-graphics)

8. **Nine social media captions** — Three must be for Twitter/X to practice writing within the character limit and force conciseness. [More details about this deliverable.]({{ site.baseurl }}/deliverables/social-captions)

**Submission note:** For any graphics embedded in Google Docs, you must also include the raw image files (PNG or JPEG) in your shared project folder.

**Presentation:** You will present your campaign during finals week. Be prepared to walk through your strategic decisions and explain each deliverable.
