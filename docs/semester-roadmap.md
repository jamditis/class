# STCM140 semester roadmap

This roadmap is based on analysis of Spring 2023, 2024, and 2025 semesters. It shows where students should be at each point in the semester.

## Semester phases

### Phase 1: Foundations (Weeks 1-6)
**Goal:** Build foundational knowledge before production begins

| Week | Focus | Key concepts |
|------|-------|--------------|
| 1-2 | Course intro, digital literacy | Cluetrain Manifesto, markets as conversations |
| 3-4 | Design principles | Visual hierarchy, typography, color theory |
| 5-6 | First deliverable | Slide deck or poster design (30-50 pts) |

**Student checkpoint:** Can articulate why good design matters in strategic communications.

---

### Phase 2: Strategy (Weeks 7-10)
**Goal:** Define audience and approach before creating content

| Week | Focus | Deliverables |
|------|-------|--------------|
| 7-8 | Audience research | Customer/user persona (25-50 pts) |
| 9 | *Spring Break* | — |
| 10 | Campaign planning | Campaign strategy document (50 pts) |

**Student checkpoint:** Has a clear persona and strategy that will guide all subsequent work.

---

### Phase 3: Content production (Weeks 11-13)
**Goal:** Execute strategy through written and visual content

| Week | Focus | Deliverables |
|------|-------|--------------|
| 11 | Copywriting | Blog post + social media copy (50 pts) |
| 12 | Visual design | Featured images for blog (50 pts) |
| 13 | Social graphics | Promotional graphics (50 pts) |

**Student checkpoint:** Has a cohesive content package: written copy + supporting visuals.

---

### Phase 4: Multimedia & capstone (Weeks 14-16)
**Goal:** Add multimedia elements and synthesize all work

| Week | Focus | Deliverables |
|------|-------|--------------|
| 14 | Audio/video | VO script, promo audio (50 pts) |
| 15-16 | Final project | Complete multimedia asset package (500 pts) |

**Student checkpoint:** Delivers a professional-quality multimedia package demonstrating mastery of all course concepts.

## Point distribution pattern

Based on historical data, expect this distribution:

| Phase | Typical points | % of grade |
|-------|---------------|------------|
| Foundations (wks 1-6) | 30-50 | 4-7% |
| Strategy (wks 7-10) | 75-125 | 10-17% |
| Production (wks 11-13) | 100-150 | 14-20% |
| Capstone (wks 14-16) | 500-550 | 67-75% |

**Key insight:** The final project is the primary assessment vehicle. Earlier assignments are scaffolding to prepare students for the capstone.

## Skill progression

Students should develop these skills in sequence:

```
Week 1-4:   [Understanding] → Digital literacy, design principles
Week 5-8:   [Analyzing]     → Audience research, persona development
Week 9-11:  [Applying]      → Strategy creation, copywriting
Week 12-14: [Creating]      → Visual design, multimedia production
Week 15-16: [Synthesizing]  → Final project integration
```

## Warning signs by week

| Week | Red flag | Intervention |
|------|----------|--------------|
| 6 | No first assignment submitted | Check in immediately |
| 8 | Persona is generic/unfocused | Provide examples, one-on-one feedback |
| 10 | Strategy doesn't connect to persona | Review persona, clarify connection |
| 12 | Visuals don't match brand/strategy | Design review session |
| 14 | Missing multiple assignments | Academic intervention, modified timeline |

---

## Historical benchmarks

### Class averages by assignment type (SP23-SP25)

| Assignment type | Typical average | Range |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------|
| Design exercises | 75-85% | B to B+ |
| Strategy documents | 70-80% | C+ to B |
| Written content | 72-82% | C+ to B |
| Visual production | 78-88% | B to A- |
| Final project | 80-90% | B to A |

*Note: Final project averages tend to be higher because students have more time and can incorporate feedback from earlier assignments.*
